* AOTT - Aspect Of The TOKENS
AOTT is a parser combinator framework / library (guh), which builds on top of chumsky's philosophies, adding a little bit of the nom sauce with functions being the primary unit of parsing (instead of structs like in chumsky).
** Thank you:
- [[https://github.com/zesterer][@zesterer]] for amazing work on [[https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky][chumsky]] and help in the Rust Community Discord server
- All [[https://github.com/rust-bakery/nom][nom]] contributors for their truly inspirational parser combinator framework library
- [[https://github.com/abs0luty][@abs0luty]] for his help at the early stages of the library and ideas for potential features.

** TO-DO / Roadmap [0/1]
- [ ] Error recovery?
  Possible solution: uncomment some prototype error recovery code in ParserExtras
  and ask [[https://github.com/abs0luty][@abs0luty]] and [[https://github.com/zesterer][@zesterer]]
